# Intrinsic Monitors Example in Java

The relevant content for this example is the Java source code for the `ReasonableGate` synchronizer, located at:

[ReasonableGate.java](../../../java/pt/isel/pc/jht/synchronizers/intrinsic/ReasonableGate.java)

This file demonstrates a synchronizer implementation using intrinsic monitors, equivalent to the `ReasonableGate` previously presented in Kotlin:

[ReasonableGate.kt](../../../03-gate/b_groupId/ReasonableGate.kt)
